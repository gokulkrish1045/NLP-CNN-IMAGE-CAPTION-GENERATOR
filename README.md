# 🖼️ Image Caption Generator using CNN & LSTM

![Image Caption Generator](result/image%20caption%20result%20.png)


Welcome to the **Image Caption Generator** repository! This project demonstrates how to generate captions for images using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** models, combining computer vision and natural language processing techniques.

## 🌟 Project Overview

In this project, I build an **Image Caption Generator** by leveraging the power of deep learning techniques. Using a CNN to extract features from images and an LSTM network to generate descriptive captions, we combine the strengths of both models for an end-to-end solution. The model is trained and evaluated using the **Flickr dataset**, which provides a vast collection of images and corresponding textual descriptions.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)** for feature extraction from images.
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** networks for sequence generation (captions).
- **End-to-end machine learning process** for building and evaluating the model.
- **Preprocessing pipeline** for images and textual data.
- **Evaluation metrics** to measure the performance of the generated captions.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- **Python** 🐍
- **TensorFlow/Keras** for building deep learning models
- **CNN & LSTM** architecture for image captioning
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive development
- **Flickr dataset** for training the model
